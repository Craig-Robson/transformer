  summary: CityCAT is a tool for modelling, analysis and visualisation of surface water flooding.
  description: >
    CityCAT (City Catchment Analysis Tool) is a unique software tool for modelling, analysis and visualisation of
    surface water flooding. CityCAT enables rapid assessment of combined pluvial and fluvial flood risk and allows
    assessment of the effects of different flood alleviation measures.
    When used in return period mode, rainfall events are generated from observations using L-moments.
